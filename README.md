Coding Test
Do all work in this single file.
Instructions
------------
1. Implement a constructor for the Author class which allows setting
the email and name for an Author.
2. Add a new property 'author' to the Article class along with a setter and getter.
Have the setter ensure that its sole argument is an Author object.
3. Implement Article's validate method based on rules in the docblock.
4. Implement the PHP built-in JsonSerializable interface on the Article class.
http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.jsonserializable.php
Only the title, body, and author name should be returned. Add any methods
to Author or Article that you need.
5. Write some procedural code (at the bottom of this file) that creates a new 
Article class, ensures that it validates, and then echoes out the Article as JSON.
Add any methods to Article that are deemed necessary.
